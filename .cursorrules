# Project Context

We are building "gtc-web", a professional web application for an industrial safety products company.
The product range includes: Coveralls (Tulum), Coats (Kaban), Shirts & Pants, Raincoats, Glasses, Gloves, and Shoes.

# Key Business Logic & Domain Knowledge

1. **Fabric Types:** For clothing items (Coveralls, Pants, etc.), there are two critical fabric distinctions that must be highlighted:
   - **Nomex:** Fire-resistant, high-performance material.
   - **GTC:** General technical cloth (or specific blend context).
2. **Product Categorization:**
   - Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) like Glasses, Gloves, Shoes should be categorized separately from Textile products.
3. **Target Audience:** B2B buyers and safety managers. The design must be clean, trustworthy, and industrial-chic.

# Tech Stack Rules

- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (App Router).
- **Language:** TypeScript (Strict mode).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS. Use `shadcn/ui` components for UI elements.
- **Icons:** Lucide React.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + Prisma.

# Coding Standards

1. **Type Safety:** Always define Interfaces/Types for product data. Never use `any`.
2. **Component Structure:**
   - Small, reusable components in `/src/components`.
   - Page logic in `/src/app`.
   - Use `export default function` for pages and components.
3. **Design System:**
   - Use a clean color palette (Industrial Greys, Safety Orange/Yellow accents).
   - Ensure specific badges for "Nomex" and "GTC" to make them stand out.

# Language

- Communicate in Turkish.
- Write code comments in English.
